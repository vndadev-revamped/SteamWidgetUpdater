## Importing the Discord Widget

This repository includes a pre-configured widget layout file:

```

steam-widget.json

```

This file is used only for importing the widget layout into Discord. It is not required for the Node.js script to run.

---

### How to import the widget

1. Open the Discord Previews server thread:
   
   https://discord.com/channels/603970300668805120/1520805824040013976/threads/1521122189993050183/1521122189993050183

2. Locate the widget import tool provided in the thread (Discord Widget Extension).

3. Open the widget import window.

4. Open the file in this repository:
```

steam-widget.json

```

5. Copy the entire contents of the file.

6. Paste it into the widget import window.

7. Click **Import**.

### Important Notes

- This file only defines the layout and data bindings.
- It does NOT contain your Steam or Discord credentials.
- The Node.js script is responsible for providing live data to this widget.
- If the widget layout is updated in the future, re-importing may be required.
